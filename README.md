Place your project ID inside .firebaserc.
Workflow
Every time you start coding on this project, pull the recent changes from the GitHub repo: git pull
Whether you implemented a feature or fixed a bug, commit the changes you have made with a meaningful commit message:
git add .
git commit -m "added Login component"
After your coding session, push your changes on the dev repo: git push origin dev
If you think your code is ready to merge, create a pull request. Note that your code should pass all tests from GitHub Actions to be able to merge. -->
